UNIT TESTING
smalliest component in programming
*procedural
*object oriented programming

Purpose: code is consistent 
isolate each part of program
shows individual parts are functing as expected

integrated development enviroment(IDE) used to carry out unit testing

IMPLEMENATION OF SDLC with TDD Test Driven Development
TDD(methodology) - approach for testing code
written before the code development

STAGE CONTAINMENT achieved by using v model and tdd where the defects are identified on the same stage where they originate
-error identification
-fix errors
-helps to exhibit defect finding pattern

Vmodel -verifies and validates the major deliverables

TECHNIQUES and ENVIRONMENT
Unit testing envi - resemble the real running environment

Unit Test should cover the following aspects:
*code units
*Branches
*Paths
*Cycles
-WHITEBOX- sees codes coz for testing

Branch coverage - 
if-else-endif
case-when-endcasae
while-endwhile

CONDITION COVERAGE- true and false condition, similar to branch coverage
boundary conditions
if else cond

LOOP
for
while
do-while

LOGIC PATH need to test logical path of current program unit

Interface Testing basis for assembly test and it is under the scope of unit test.

DELIVERABLES documented information and knowledge produced as the result of a methodology process
*provides docu
completetion of each phase
traceability
quality in task performed
analysis of issue

TESTING FRAMEWORK TOOLS
*manual - 
*automated - automation tools used
*static - where software not used
-dry run test
*dynamic - software, where u need to provide input values
